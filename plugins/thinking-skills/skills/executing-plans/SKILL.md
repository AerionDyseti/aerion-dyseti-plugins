# Executing Plans

## Overview

Take an implementation plan and orchestrate its execution. Read the plan, understand the dependency graph, and dispatch work — preferring parallel execution whenever tasks are independent.

**Input:** A plan from writing-plans (`docs/plans/`) or a plan provided by the user.

## Phase 1: Load and Review

1. Read the plan file thoroughly
2. Map the dependency graph — which tasks block which
3. Identify the first wave of tasks that have no dependencies
4. Review critically: raise any concerns or ambiguities with the user before starting
5. Confirm the execution strategy from the plan header (agent team / subagents / serial)

## Before Each Task: Check Your Understanding

Before starting any task (or dispatching it to an agent), pause and ask: do I have all the information needed to do this well? Specifically:

- Can the task be completed with what's in the plan, or are there gaps?
- Can missing information be acquired with available tools (search the codebase, read files, check symbols)?
- Or do you need to ask the user?

Don't start implementing with incomplete understanding. A few minutes of investigation up front prevents wasted work.

## Phase 2: Execute

### Agent Team (default for 3+ independent tasks)

Use `TeamCreate` to set up a team, then:

1. Create all tasks from the plan using `TaskCreate`, setting up dependency chains with `addBlockedBy`
2. Spawn teammates — one per parallel track of work
3. Assign the first wave of unblocked tasks to teammates
4. As teammates complete tasks, assign newly unblocked tasks
5. Monitor progress via `TaskList` and teammate messages
6. When a teammate hits a blocker, help resolve it or escalate to the user

**Team sizing:** Match the number of teammates to the number of parallel tracks, not the number of tasks. 2-4 teammates is typical. Don't spawn more agents than you have independent work for.

**Teammate prompts should include:**
- The specific task description from the plan
- Relevant context (file paths, patterns to follow, dependencies that are now complete)
- The verification command to run when done
- Commit instructions

### Independent Subagents (isolated parallel work)

Use the `Task` tool to dispatch subagents for tasks that are fully independent and don't need coordination:

1. Launch subagents for all unblocked tasks in parallel
2. Wait for results
3. Review outputs before moving to the next wave
4. Launch the next wave of unblocked tasks

### Serial (tightly coupled work)

Execute tasks one at a time:

1. Work through tasks in order
2. Run verification after each task
3. Commit after each task (or per the plan's commit strategy)
4. Checkpoint with the user between logical groups

## Phase 3: Review Checkpoints

Regardless of execution strategy, pause for user review at natural boundaries:

- After the first wave of parallel tasks completes
- When a task fails verification or hits an unexpected issue
- At phase boundaries in the plan (e.g., "infrastructure" tasks done, moving to "feature" tasks)
- When making a judgment call not covered by the plan

At each checkpoint:
- Summarize what was completed and what's next
- Show verification results
- Flag anything that deviated from the plan
- Ask: "Ready to continue?"

## When to Stop

**Stop and ask the user immediately when:**
- A task fails verification and the fix isn't obvious
- Two teammates hit a merge conflict or contradictory changes
- The plan has a gap — a task references something that doesn't exist
- You're unsure whether a deviation from the plan is acceptable
- A blocking task is stuck and nothing else can proceed

**Don't guess through ambiguity. Ask.**

## Key Principles

- **Parallel by default** — If tasks don't depend on each other, run them simultaneously
- **Dependencies are the bottleneck** — Focus on unblocking the critical path
- **Fresh agents, full context** — Each agent gets the specific context it needs, not the entire plan
- **Verify before moving on** — Never mark a task done without running its verification step
- **The plan is a guide, not a script** — Agents should understand the intent and implement it well, not mechanically follow pseudo-code

**Next:** Use the verification-before-completion skill before claiming the work is done.
